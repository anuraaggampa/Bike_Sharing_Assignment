## General Information
- The project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of a bike-sharing dataset with the primary goal of predicting daily bike rental demand. This predictive modeling effort is aimed at assisting a bike-sharing provider, referred to as BoomBikes, to navigate the challenges posed by fluctuating demand, especially in the context of the ongoing global situation that has significantly impacted urban mobility patterns.
- The emergence of bike-sharing systems has revolutionized urban transportation, offering an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and healthy alternative to traditional transport modes. These systems allow users to rent bikes from a network of docking stations spread across a city, catering to both regular commuters and casual riders.
- BoomBikes has faced considerable dips in revenue due to the unpredictable changes in demand patterns, largely influenced by the ongoing global health crisis. The primary business challenge is to develop a resilient operational strategy that not only withstands current market volatilities but also positions BoomBikes favorably for future growth. A key component of this strategy is the ability to accurately forecast demand, enabling efficient management of resources, optimizing service availability, and enhancing customer satisfaction.


- The dataset encompasses daily records of bike rentals over two years, detailing:

Temporal variables: Date, year, month, weekday.
Weather-related variables: Temperature, humidity, windspeed, weather conditions.
Usage variables: Count of casual and registered users, total daily rentals (cnt).

## Conclusions
- When it's Warm, More People Bike: It turns out that the time of year makes a big difference. Summer and spring see a lot more bikers compared to the colder months. Basically, if it's nice outside, more folks are likely to grab a bike.
- Sunny Days Win: Aside from just being warm, the weather plays a big role too. People prefer biking when it’s clear and sunny over when it’s rainy or too windy. Makes sense, right? No one wants to bike in a storm.
- Different Strokes for Different Folks: We noticed two main types of bikers - those who bike now and then (casual bikers) and those who bike pretty much all the time (registered bikers). Casual bikers especially like good weather, while regular bikers keep at it rain or shine.
- Looking Back Helps Us Plan Ahead: By examining past data, we’ve gotten pretty good at predicting when bikes will be in high demand. This helps make sure there are enough bikes to go around when more people want to use them.
